            <p>I'm Joseph Wynn, a <b>full stack developer</b> and <b>engineering team lead</b> with a focus on <b>performance</b> and <b>accessibility</b>. My experience ranges building high-traffic, high-availability distributed systems at the BBC to interactive UI components and real-time data processing systems at SpeedCurve.</p>

            <p>On my journey to build better systems, I've become a <b>polyglot</b> and a <b>generalist</b>. I've written software in many languages at almost every layer of the web stack: database, back end, API, front end, UI, CDN, automation, tooling, testing, and server management.</p>

            <p>Outside of my professional work, I maintain some <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate">open source projects</a> and occasionally <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/">write about my experiences</a>.</p>
