            <p>I'm Joseph Wynn, a <b>full stack developer</b> and <b>engineering team lead</b> with a focus on <b>performance</b> and <b>accessibility</b>. My experience ranges from building high-traffic distributed systems to crafting rich interactive UI components, to designing real-time data processing systems.</p>

            <p>On my journey to build better systems, I've become a <b>polyglot</b> and a <b>generalist</b>. I've written software in many languages at almost every layer of the web stack: database, back end, API, front end, UI, CDN, automation, developer tooling, testing, and server management.</p>

            <p>Outside of my professional work, I maintain several <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate">open source projects</a> and occasionally <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/">write about my experiences</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Experience</h2>

        <h3>2017&ndash;present: SpeedCurve</h3>
        <p>Originally joining a small team, I had the chance to work on everything from the data layer, API, and backend to the web interface and developer tooling. I took ownership of SpeedCurve's real user monitoring (RUM) product, improving the capabilities of the real-time data pipeline, data warehousing, and reporting system. I have also enjoyed providing customer support and writing documentation. The most exciting part of this role has been transitioning to Head of Engineering and helping to expand the engineering team and lead the development of a React-based component library.</p>

        <h3>2014&ndash;2017: BBC News</h3>
        <p>Working across several teams, I helped to deliver the BBC's responsive web platform and new front-end component library. I later moved into a Principal Engineer position where I led the team responsible for building <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/introducing-a-faster-bbc-news-front-page/">a better BBC News front page</a> and the BBC's <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/how-we-assemble-web-pages-at-bbc-news/">next web platform</a>. As my role shifted to include more management responsibility, I focussed on <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/becoming-a-team-lead-a-survival-guide/">growing &amp; supporting the people around me</a>.</p>

        <h3>2013&ndash;2014: Rightster</h3>
        <p>Working closely with product developers and designers, I helped build Rightster's new video distribution platform. This role involved writing a lot of code and co-ordinating feature development with other teams. It was very satisfying to build a product from the ground up, and to ensure our development practices allowed the team to grow quickly.</p>

        <h3>2012&ndash;2013: Time Inc. UK</h3>
        <p>Built websites for magazine brands, just as print media started dying. Learned a myriad of useful things including programming at the CDN edge, proper change management, automated testing, and data-driven product development.</p>

        <h3>2009&ndash;2012: Various</h3>
        <p>Web work at various agencies in Christchurch and London. Let's talk over a cup of tea if you want to know more!</p>

        <p>A tiny (800 byte) library that converts absolute dates to relative, human-readable strings. If you've used npm, then you've used this project!</p>
