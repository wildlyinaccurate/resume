            <p class="lead">Kia ora!</p>

            <p>I'm Joseph Wynn, an <b>engineering team lead</b> and <b>software developer</b> based in Ōtautahi Christchurch. My experience ranges from building high-traffic distributed systems to growing and supporting engineering teams; from crafting rich interactive UI components to implementing real-time data processing pipelines.</p>

            <p>On my journey to build better systems I've become a <b>polyglot</b> and a <b>generalist</b>. I've written software in many languages at almost every layer of the web stack: database, backend, API, frontend, CDN/edge, tooling, and testing.</p>

            <p>Outside of my professional work I maintain several <a href="https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate">open source projects</a>, (infrequently) <a href="https://blog.structuredthoughts.dev/">write software development guides</a>, and (even less frequently) <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/">write about other stuff</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Want to know more?</b> Ask me to walk you through SpeedCurve's real user monitoring (RUM) architecture, or how I coordinated several teams building the BBC's next web platform.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>2017&ndash;present: SpeedCurve</h3>
        <p>Originally joining a small team, I had the chance to work on everything from the data layer, API, and backend to the web interface and developer tooling. I took ownership of SpeedCurve's real user monitoring (RUM) product, improving the capabilities of the real-time data pipeline, data warehousing, and reporting system. I have also enjoyed providing customer support and writing documentation. During this role I transitioned to Head of Engineering where I expanded the engineering team and oversaw technical direction while still contributing as a developer.</p>

        <h3>2014&ndash;2017: BBC News</h3>
        <p>Working across several teams, I helped to deliver the BBC's responsive web platform and new front-end component library. I worked on the CI pipeline that enabled teams to move from weekly deploys to several deploys per day, and built automated testing tooling to increase QA productivity. I later moved into a Principal Engineer position where I led the team responsible for building <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/introducing-a-faster-bbc-news-front-page/">a better BBC News front page</a> and the BBC's <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/how-we-assemble-web-pages-at-bbc-news/">next web platform</a>. As my role shifted to include more management responsibility, I focused on <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/becoming-a-team-lead-a-survival-guide/">growing &amp; supporting the people around me</a>.</p>

        <h3>2013&ndash;2014: Rightster</h3>
        <p>Working closely with product developers and designers, I helped build Rightster's new video distribution platform. This role involved writing a lot of code and co-ordinating feature development with other teams. In between shipping features, I implemented a Git workflow that helped to reduce the chaos of multiple teams working on the same source code. It was this Git workflow that led me to write <a href="https://wildlyinaccurate.com/a-hackers-guide-to-git/"><i>A Hacker's Guide to Git</i></a>. It was very satisfying to build a product from the ground up, and to ensure our development practices allowed the team to grow quickly.</p>

        <h3>2012&ndash;2013: Time Inc. UK</h3>
        <p>Built websites for magazine brands, just as print media started dying. Learned a myriad of useful things including programming at the CDN edge, proper change management, automated testing, and data-driven product development.</p>

        <h3>2009&ndash;2012: Various</h3>
        <p>Web work at various agencies in Christchurch and London. Let's talk over a cup of tea if you want to know more!</p>
